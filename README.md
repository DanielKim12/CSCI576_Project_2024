## Searching and Indexing Video with Input Clip
This repository contains our CSCI 576: Multimedia Design Final Project. The project's aim is as follows: Given an input video clip with accompanying audio, the program will search through a database of videos with accompanying audio and determine which database video the input video clip is from and when it starts in the original.

## Setup
In the root directory of this repository, run the following:

```bash
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```
