## Searching and Indexing Video with Input Clip
This repository hosts our final project for CSCI 576: Multimedia Design. The project is designed to take an input video clip along with its audio and identify which video from a database it originates from. Additionally, the program will determine the exact starting point of the clip within the original video.

## Setup
In the root directory of this repository, run the following:

```bash
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```
